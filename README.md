Heyo, I'm Shibe Drill, aka River [she/they]. I’m interested in:  

- systems development,  
- operating systems,  
- cybersecurity,  
- and systems administration.

I’m basically fluent in Python, and trying to master Rust as a second language. I also know some BASH, a bunch of Java, and a tiny bit of C++.  
You can reach me via @shibedrill on Discord, or shibedrill1@gmail.com for email. You can check out a more extensive & personal About Me at https://riverdev.carrd.co.  
My [public PGP key](River_0x945EFAA2_public.asc) is available, alongside a [signed message](signed_message.txt), if you wish to confirm my identity.
